# ADSync
![Logo](img/logo.png)
Sync to AD from KAMAR using a PHP listening / LDAP service.

This incorporates a listening service for KAMAR and then a file that processes that Data and updates AD using LDAP

I am not 100% sure it is working yet... still have a few things to test.

Full documentation will be coming soon... but feel free to take it and fiddle with it.
I won't be held responsible if I break your AD though.
